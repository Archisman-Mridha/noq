# Noq

Building an expression transformer in Rust. It is similar to Coq.

> NOTE - I only caught up till the 2nd episode. After episode 2, he pushed updates to the sourcecode offstream. Currently, I don't have time to read and debug what code changes he did offstream ðŸ™‚ (starting from commit - https://github.com/tsoding/Noq/commit/45481d8fcaee82e6c84719aeda806ad7b5e18a8c).

## Credits

All credits go to [Alexey Kutepov](https://github.com/rexim). Noq is originally developed by him and you can watch him doing it here - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZVE64QKPf6y_TIUwj5nKQ7. I just followed this playlist, coding along with him.

I didn't make any enhancements on the transformation engine, though I made the *`sourcecode more readable`* by using more user friendly names and meaningful comments. Enjoy ðŸ˜‰!
