# Noq

Building an expression transformer in Rust. It is similar to Coq.

## Quick Start

cargo run
```

## Credits

All credit goes to [Alexey Kutepov](https://github.com/rexim). Noq is originally developed by him and you can watch him doing it in this playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZVE64QKPf6y_TIUwj5nKQ7. I just followed this playlist coding along with him.

I didn't make any enhancements on the transformation engine, though I made the *`sourcecode more readable`* by using more user friendly names and meaningful comments. Enjoy ðŸ˜‰
